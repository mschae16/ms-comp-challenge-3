# ms-comp-challenge-3
## Synopsis
This project required the design of a fully responsive website, based on the original comp provided below. In my version, I have tried to match the original layout and colour scheme as closely as I can. In addition, the flexibility of the design as one moves to a tablet-size or mobile version of the site was my responsibility to design and execute.
